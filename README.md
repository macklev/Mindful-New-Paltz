# MindPath

## Finding activities to build community and support the mental health of freshman can be overwhelming. MindPath lets you search for activities by distance, type of activity, price point, and season to eliminate an extra step that might bar SUNY New Paltz students from finding resources in the community. 

## MindPath also includes a progress tracking feature: There are four core "tracks" we focus on: Nature, Movement, Community, and Service. When you complete an activity in a category, you can mark it as complete and see your progress bar fill up!
